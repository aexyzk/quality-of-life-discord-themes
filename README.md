 Removes Nitro/Shop ads and some features that make Discord usable as a touch interface. I don't claim any of this code as my own, as I used sevaral diffrent sources around the internet and kinda mashed them together. Mostly just uploading this to github so i can download it whenever :3

# How to use.
